# Your First Dev Project

The aim of this set of examples/tutorials/workshop is to get some basic concepts right, and then dive into and totally hands-on project.

A major hurdle in getting started with a project is understanding how to start, what to make and the depth of things to explore.

We'll try here to avoid this hassle by making you follow the steps mentioned, make something and feel accomplished at the completion of your first project.
